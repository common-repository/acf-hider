ACF Hider is a tiny plugin that hides the Advanced Custom Fields menu item. This is useful if you don't want to anyone to change your ACF fields. It's especially useful if you're registering your ACF fields using PHP ([see here](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/register-fields-via-php/)).

### Features

* Redirects the user to the Admin Dashboard if the item is accessed directly.
